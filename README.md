## Database

You can access data from [api.nweoo.com (API)](https://api.nweoo.com) by issuing `GET` request to its URL endpoint.

### Infrastructure

We can access the data from [Firebase Realtime Database (RTDB)](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/rest/retrieve-data) with [Firebase Admin SDK (Admin)](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/admin/start) to retrieve an array of articles.

### Queries

As far as our database is from [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database), use wildcard (symbol: "**ï£¿**", hex: <kbd>\uf8ff</kbd>).

#### Retrieving Data

In this example, let's request the list of latest news articles.

```http
GET https://api.nweoo.com/news/articles HTTP/2
```

```http
HTTP/2 200 OK
Cache-Control; public, max-age=900, s-max-age=900
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8

[{...},{...},{...},{...},{...},{...},{...},{...},{...},{...}]
```
